# Event Listener

## Introduction

This is an exercise designed to practice the implementation of the addEventListener method in JavaScript, a powerful tool that allows developers to attach event handlers to elements in a web page, enabling interactive and dynamic functionality. By mastering the utilization of addEventListener, developers can enhance user experiences by responding to various user actions, such as clicks, mouse movements, keypresses, and more, enabling the creation of engaging and responsive web applications.

Furthermore, in this exercise, you can also explore the utilization of the speechSynthesis property in JavaScript. The speechSynthesis API provides a way to convert text into synthesized speech, allowing developers to incorporate text-to-speech capabilities into their web applications. By harnessing the power of the speechSynthesis property in JavaScript, you can enable text-to-speech functionality that supports different languages. The speechSynthesis API provides access to a variety of voices, each representing a specific language or accent, allowing you to cater to a diverse range of users. With a few lines of code, you can select the desired voice for synthesis, providing localized and multilingual experiences for your application's users.
